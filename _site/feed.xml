        <title>The U.S. Department of Energy Exascale Computing Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 the U.S. Department of Energy established the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) – a joint project
of the DOE Office of Science (DOE-SC) and the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) –
that will result in a capable exascale ecosystem and prepare mission critical scientific and engineering
applications to take advantage of that ecosystem.
This presentation will describe the goals of the ECP, its plans for achieving them, the challenges to be
overcome, and its current status, as well as what elements of the exascale ecosystem are outside of the
scope of the ECP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-paul-messina&quot;&gt;Dr. Paul Messina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Messina is Advisor to the Associate Laboratory Director and
Laboratory on Exascale and Argonne Distinguished Fellow at Argonne
National Laboratory.
His current role is Project Director for the U.S. DOE Exascale Computing
Project, a multi-laboratory project. During 2008-2015 he served as
Director of Science for the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility and in
2002-2004 as Distinguished Senior Computer Scientist at Argonne and
as Advisor to the Director General at CERN (European Organization for
Nuclear Research).
From 1987-2002, Dr. Messina served as founding Director of California
Institute of Technology’s (Caltech) Center for Advanced Computing Research, as Assistant Vice President
for Scientific Computing, and as Faculty Associate for Scientific Computing, Caltech. During a leave from
Caltech in 1999-2000, he led the DOE-NNSA Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative.
In his first association with Argonne from 1973-1987, he held a number of positions in the Applied Mathematics
Division and was the founding Director of the Mathematics and Computer Science Division.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PETASCALE TO EXTREME SCALES</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Waters, the first sustainable Petascale System and one of the largest and most open systems in the
world, has been providing high quality service for over three years. Not only is it a great resource the enables
unprecedented research, it is also an experimental platform for the convergence of Extreme Computing
and Big Data. This talk will cover the experiences of the Blue Waters project and discuss the successes and
challenges in merging widely different workflows on the same system. Finally, it will explore lessons and
observations for next generations of Extreme Scale systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;william-kramer&quot;&gt;William Kramer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Kramer joins CS @ ILLINOIS as a research professor this year.
Since 2008, he has been with the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) on the University of Illinois campus, where he is
the director and principal investigator of the Blue Waters petascale
supercomputer project.
Prior to joining the University of Illinois, Kramer was the general manager
of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Before that he worked at
the NASA Ames Research Center, where he was responsible for all aspects
of operations and customer service for NASA’s Numerical Aerodynamic
Simulator (NAS) supercomputer center and other large computational
projects as well as starting a major Air Traffic Control Program&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3D BIOPRINTING AS A BIO-INFORMATIONAL TECHNOLOGY</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most advanced forms of biofabrication, bioprinting is very information-dense, for at least
three reasons: a) manipulates living matter, the richest existing information source; b) is very complex
technologically, thus cannot be performed unless using computerized assistance; c) is being currently
transferred, with all the implications, in Virtual Reality by computer modeling. I will illustrate these concepts
with the case of ‘scaffold-free’ bioprinting as performed on the Regenova Bio 3D Printer commercialized by
Cyfuse Biomedical K.K. This advanced technology is now available in the recently-created 3D Bioprinting
Core facility that serves the IUPUI and IUSM researchers in Indianapolis and Bloomington, and those in
Midwest USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nicanor I. Moldovan is an Associate Research Professor and Director of the 3D Bioprinting Core at IUPUI and Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. He has training in Biophysics, Tissue Engineering, and Cardiovascular Medicine. His current interests are in scaffold-free biofabrication, bioprinting, implant bio-compatibility, and in computer
modeling of cells and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
