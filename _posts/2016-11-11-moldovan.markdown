## Abstract

As one of the most advanced forms of biofabrication, bioprinting is very information-dense, for at least
three reasons: a) manipulates living matter, the richest existing information source; b) is very complex
technologically, thus cannot be performed unless using computerized assistance; c) is being currently
transferred, with all the implications, in Virtual Reality by computer modeling. I will illustrate these concepts
with the case of ‘scaffold-free’ bioprinting as performed on the Regenova Bio 3D Printer commercialized by
Cyfuse Biomedical K.K. This advanced technology is now available in the recently-created 3D Bioprinting
Core facility that serves the IUPUI and IUSM researchers in Indianapolis and Bloomington, and those in
Midwest USA
