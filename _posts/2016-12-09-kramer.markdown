## Abstract
Blue Waters, the first sustainable Petascale System and one of the largest and most open systems in the
world, has been providing high quality service for over three years. Not only is it a great resource the enables
unprecedented research, it is also an experimental platform for the convergence of Extreme Computing
and Big Data. This talk will cover the experiences of the Blue Waters project and discuss the successes and
challenges in merging widely different workflows on the same system. Finally, it will explore lessons and
observations for next generations of Extreme Scale systems.
